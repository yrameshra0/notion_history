# notion_history - Commit History from Notion
Coupe of facts-
* Power user of notion
* Using notion for documenting Tasks, Documents and Personal Articles

Personally for me a view of github.com commit history really gives a kicker to be more active and go for that last mile.
Not sure what I'm talking about take a look below:

Nice right!!

## What should we do to come up with this view
We require pretty much three things IMO:
1. Connection to Notion API (Which is now Available)
1. Code snippet generating the timeline view we are talking about
1. A sink location may be uploading to notion back or else hosted some place in cloud ?

## What we personally learning from this exercise
1. Setting up jupiter notebooks on local instance
1. Python usage for connecting to the API
1. Python for visuallizing data
1. Python for pushing the data into 3rd API of hosting the same on cloud
1. Deployments as and when the time comes
1. Data cleaning techniques
1. Data massaging techniques
